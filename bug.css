This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive with a class that contains a pseudo-selector, such as `:hover` or `:focus`.  The `@apply` directive doesn't correctly apply the styles from the class to the element when the pseudo-selector is active. For example:

```html
<button class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">
  Click Me
</button>
```

```css
/* Tailwind config */
.my-hover-class {
  @apply hover:bg-blue-700;
}
```

The `hover:bg-blue-700` within the `.my-hover-class` won't work as expected, the hover effect will not be applied.
